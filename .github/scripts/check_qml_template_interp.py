r"""Check for unescaped bash parameter expansion inside QML template literals.

QML (like JavaScript) treats `` `...${...}...` `` as a template literal where
``${...}`` is evaluated as JavaScript before the string is used. Embedded bash
scripts therefore must escape a literal ``${`` as ``\${`` — e.g. ``${1#v}``
must be written ``\${1#v}``.

Leaving it unescaped makes the QML engine parse bash syntax as JavaScript and
fail with an error like ``Expected token ','``. Because every singleton that
transitively imports the broken file then reports "Type X unavailable", the
failure cascades across the whole shell (see shell/services/UpdateChecker.qml,
which shipped ``${1#v}`` unescaped and broke every singleton on load).

A backtick does the same in one step, and it is easier to do by accident: it is
the literal's own delimiter, so a stray one in a comment ends the script there.
That file has since been broken that way too, by a comment naming a command in
backticks - hence the second check below.

The fix for that broke it a third time, in a comment that explained the rule by
writing ``${...}``. Its body was ``...``, which is neither valid JavaScript nor
recognised bash, so the body check below let it through; the engine interpolated
it anyway and failed the file with ``Expected token 'numeric literal'``. That is
the reason for the comment rule: a comment is prose, so no interpolation in one
can be intended, and every unescaped ``${`` on a comment line inside a literal is
now flagged whatever its body looks like.

This checker scans every backtick template literal in QML files and flags
unescaped ``${...}`` in comments, unescaped backticks in comments, and unescaped
``${...}`` in code whose body is clearly bash parameter expansion rather than
valid JavaScript. Legitimate interpolation (identifiers, member access, calls,
ternaries) is left alone.

Usage:
    python3 check_qml_template_interp.py            # all *.qml under repo root
    python3 check_qml_template_interp.py <paths...> # specific files/dirs

Exit code is 1 if any offending interpolation is found.
